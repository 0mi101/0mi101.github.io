      <p class="text"> Roblox is a fantastic game with amazing graphics, community, and is generally a great game overall. Just kidding. Roblox is a game in which players create and play maps, and is directed towards younger children. The maps can have various scenarios and thematic designs, and you can play with friends or strangers. Whilst this sounds good in theory, it hardly is in practice. </p>
      <p class="text"> Because Roblox is targeted towards children, a majority of the player-base consists of children (keep in mind, a targeted demographic does not necessarily represent the entire audience of players). This means that if you are not in fact a young child, the game may instantly be less enjoyable for you. </p>
      <p class="text"> Roblox has below average anti-aliasing, and below average graphics. This isn’t a major problem, as some games pull this off quite nicely, and have a certain charm to them. Roblox is not one of those games, with graphics reminiscent of the nightmare 90’s game Bubzy3D.  </p>
      <p class="text"> Due to the independent server system of Roblox, moderators of said servers are not associated with Roblox, and thus have no need to be fair and there is no real judicial system, apart from the one laid out by the moderators. While this is normally not a bad thing, this also means moderators can hand out biased bans with little to no transgression of server rules, which is rare, but still existent. </p>
      <p class="text"> Unfortunately, an otherwise decent game is let down by its below-par community, and other than what has been mentioned so far, there is not much else to say about Roblox, and due to its cons outweighing its pros, Roblox deserves an under average score. </p>
      <p class="text"> All of the above problems can be rectified simply by playing Roblox with your friends on your own private server, however, that could be said for most other multi-player based games. </p>
